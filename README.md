mkdir git                                               :: create new git folder if you need one
cd git                                                  :: open the git folder

# Compilation:
You need to execute this command every time you want to continue developing your game.  
Open console, make sure you are in the "git/tsgame" folder and execute:

It will watch your source files and re-compile them every time you change them.  
This command will run until you kill it with "Ctrl + c".
